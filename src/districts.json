After law school, instead of joining a big corporate law firm, Brent continued with his passion&mdash;supporting workers&rsquo; rights as designated legal counsel for a national labor union. In these roles, Brent worked with local and national leaders to create better paying jobs, revitalize small businesses, and achieve better access to good healthcare. Brent understands the pain and fear that too many families face. Brent held key positions with Barack Obama, Bernie Sanders, and Patrick Murphy, the first Iraq Veteran elected to the U.S. Congress. As National Field Director for the Teamsters union, Brent organized over a million union members for better wages, benefits, and workplace safety. But for far too long under our rigged economy, giant corporations have been taking advantage of our communities and workers through lower wages and higher prices&mdash;shipping the profits away from our community to Wall Street banks and off-shore accounts. Brent is running to fix that. He will represent hard working Kansas families&mdash;not billionaires and giant corporations.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Roboto-Slab, sans-serif; color: #343438; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline;\">&rdquo;<em>As a worker&rsquo;s rights advocate and labor lawyer, I&rsquo;ve spent my career fighting the giant corporations that rig the economy against workers and our community.

After law school, instead of joining a big corporate law firm, Brent continued with his passion&mdash;supporting workers&rsquo; rights as designated legal counsel for a national labor union. In these roles, Brent worked with local and national leaders to create better paying jobs, revitalize small businesses, and achieve better access to good healthcare. Brent understands the pain and fear that too many families face. Brent held key positions with Barack Obama, Bernie Sanders, and Patrick Murphy, the first Iraq Veteran elected to the U.S. Congress. As National Field Director for the Teamsters union, Brent organized over a million union members for better wages, benefits, and workplace safety. But for far too long under our rigged economy, giant corporations have been taking advantage of our communities and workers through lower wages and higher prices&mdash;shipping the profits away from our community to Wall Street banks and off-shore accounts. Brent is running to fix that. He will represent hard working Kansas families&mdash;not billionaires and giant corporations.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Roboto-Slab, sans-serif; color: #343438; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline;\">&rdquo;<em>As a worker&rsquo;s rights advocate and labor lawyer, I&rsquo;ve spent my career fighting the giant corporations that rig the economy against workers and our community.

At JFK High School, Jenny served as the Student Council Adviser, a member of the School Improvement team, and the chair of the Social Studies Department. She is also an active member of her local, state and national teachers association. Jenny&rsquo;s work as an educator goes beyond her work in the classroom, though &mdash; While she was teaching in Indiana, Jenny took the lead in building one of the largest coalitions of teachers, parents, and education advocates to fight against the GOP&rsquo;s attack on public education and the teachers&rsquo; unions. Jenny&rsquo;s group of over 9,000 advocates collaborated with labor unions and civic groups to organize rallies, town halls, and letter-writing campaigns. Their efforts resulted in real change as the state legislature was forced to abandon some of the most horrible attacks on students and educators. As shown, Jenny is a fighter and she will continue the fight for all of us in Washington D.C.</span></p><p style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Roboto-Slab, sans-serif; color: #343438; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline;\">In addition to educational causes, Jenny has devoted her life to advancing progressive candidates and values at all levels of government.

She has spent thousands of hours knocking on doors, making phone calls, and organizing her community for progressive candidates. In 2016, she\norganized her precinct and flipped it from red to blue for the first time in a decade.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Roboto-Slab, sans-serif; color: #343438; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline;\">&rdquo;<em>For far too long our families and communities have been ignored, dismissed and disenfranchised.

Later, as a CFO in the non-profit sector, she fought to ensure federal funds for HUD programs and Medicaid reached those that needed it most. Her story illustrates how necessary public assistance is while also demonstrating how\ninadequate and alienating our current system and policies are. We must stop thinking of\nvital social programs as a &quot;safety net&quot; to catch us when we fall. Policies that meet everyone&#39;s basic needs &ndash; a guaranteed livable wage, access to free public education and healthcare, affordable housing &ndash; need to be recognized as the concrete foundation upon which our society is built, allowing us all to grow, thrive, and reach our full potential with equity and dignity.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Roboto-Slab, sans-serif; color: #343438; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline;\">&rdquo;<em>Racial, social, and economic injustice are pervasive in America.

Later, as a CFO in the non-profit sector, she fought to ensure federal funds for HUD programs and Medicaid reached those that needed it most. Her story illustrates how necessary public assistance is while also demonstrating how\ninadequate and alienating our current system and policies are. We must stop thinking of\nvital social programs as a &quot;safety net&quot; to catch us when we fall.

James served in the Army as an infantryman in the Presidential Honor Guard. Following an honorable discharge, James moved to Kansas to be close to family and used his GI Bill to attend Wichita State University and Washburn University Law School. Now, he is a civil rights attorney in Wichita who is running for Congress because he knows the opportunities afforded to him helped change his life, and those opportunities need to be available to future generations. He believes our elected offices should ensure people up and down the economic ladder have the ability to build a better, brighter future for themselves and their children. Regardless of race, nation of origin, gender, religion, socioeconomic background or intellectual ability, James will fight for a better Kansas for all Kansans. <br></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Roboto-Slab, sans-serif; color: #101012; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline;\">Help us spread the message abou<span style=\"color: #000000;\">t <strong>James Thompson</strong>&#39;s</span> mission to bring real change to Kansas District-04 and to America and make some calls!&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Roboto-Slab,sans-serif; color: #561678; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline;\"><span style=\"color: #101012;\"><strong>To read the rest of James Thompson&rsquo;s story,&nbsp;</strong></span><a href=\"http://www.votejamesthompson.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click or tap here</strong>.</a></span></p></div>","callable":"Callable","brands":["jd"]},"created_by":"59396feb93edb3da07003b99","created_at":"2017-11-14T18:15:56.468Z","created":"2017-11-14T18:15:56.468Z","content":"","bucket":"59397094f15158ea07003890","_id":"5a0b32ddcb5c822837000119"},{"type_slug":"candidates","title":"Dan Canon","status":"published","slug":"dan-canon","published_at":"2018-04-08T13:23:45.742Z","publish_at":null,"modified_by":"59a81f884a42effa2300007c","modified_at":"2018-04-08T13:23:45.742Z","metafields":[{"value":"Launched","type":"radio-buttons","title":"Launch Status","required":true,"options":[{"value":"Not Launched"},{"value":"Launched"}],"key":"launch_status","children":null},{"value":["jd"],"type":"check-boxes","title":"Brands","required":true,"options":[{"value":"bnc"},{"value":"jd"}],"key":"brands","children":null},{"value":"83ae4160-da9f-11e7-a2da-2db2f379bb85-JD_Site_DanCanon_1000x600_110317.jpg","url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cosmicjs/83ae4160-da9f-11e7-a2da-2db2f379bb85-JD_Site_DanCanon_1000x600_110317.jpg","type":"file","title":"Small Picture","key":"small_picture","imgix_url":"https://cosmic-s3.imgix.net/83ae4160-da9f-11e7-a2da-2db2f379bb85-JD_Site_DanCanon_1000x600_110317.jpg","children":null},{"value":"Dan is a civil rights attorney who has spent his career fighting for those who would not otherwise have a voice in the justice system.

Prior to her role at Enlace, she served as a Law Professor at UNM for over 27 years, including eight years as Associate Dean of UNM&rsquo;s Clinical Law program. In this role she supervised law students in serving low income clients in a variety of settings. Antoinette&rsquo;s leadership in legal education and on critical social and civil rights issues has earned her numerous awards and national recognition. Antoinette grew up on her parents&rsquo; farm in Los Chavez, New Mexico. After graduating, Antoinette pursued her dream of becoming an attorney, enrolling and excelling first at UNM and then at UCLA School of Law where she met her husband Victor. As a 14th generation and life-long New Mexican, Antoinette has deep roots in the state. She has been closely involved with numerous organizations in her community including serving on the boards of the New Mexico Coalition Against Domestic Violence, Valley Improvement Association Board, Bernalillo County/City of Albuquerque Air Quality Control Board, the Southwest Women&rsquo;s Law Center, and the New Mexico Hispanic Bar Association. Antoinette is building a broad coalition of support rooted in her decades of service to communities throughout the district.

Daily Action has notched real victories, like pressuring the House GOP to walk back their plans to gut the Congressional Ethics Office. Daily Action members also placed a record number of calls to senators regarding Trump&rsquo;s terrible choice for Secretary of Labor, who eventually withdrew his name from consideration.

Following the 2016 election, she founded Daily Action, a text-messaging service that allows people to engage directly in the political process. Daily Action has tapped into demand from 300,000 people to take direct political action daily all over the country. Daily Action has notched real victories, like pressuring the House GOP to walk back their plans to gut the Congressional Ethics Office. Daily Action members also placed a record number of calls to senators regarding Trump&rsquo;s terrible choice for Secretary of Labor, who eventually withdrew his name from consideration. Daily Action callers have led the fight against the repeal of Obamacare: The service connected more than a quarter of a million calls to protect the Affordable Care Act.

She served eight years in the U.S. Army. In 2005 she deployed to Iraq, with an otherwise all male combat unit. Due to her rank as a non-commissioned officer, she was often asked to lead combat patrols, organize traffic checkpoints, and manage base security. In the spring of 2015, Dorothy joined in the efforts and began working to build the progressive movement in Clark County. She worked tirelessly to register voters and inform them about the caucus process. In her role as a community organizer, she developed and encouraged emergent leaders throughout the county to build a cohesive network of dynamic organizers and volunteers. As assistant director of the non-profit startup Concerned Humans Against Poverty (CHAP) Dorothy has organized dozens of volunteers that are making immediate positive changes for our houseless neighbors. Dorothy works to support other veterans and is the First Vice Chair of Washington State Veterans and Military Families Caucus.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Roboto-Slab, sans-serif; color: #343438; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline;\">&rdquo;<em>I saw a nation that jumps into conflict without compelling reason, and wastes precious resources and life in the process.

She served eight years in the U.S. Army. In 2005 she deployed to Iraq, with an otherwise all male combat unit. Due to her rank as a non-commissioned officer, she was often asked to lead combat patrols, organize traffic checkpoints, and manage base security. In the spring of 2015, Dorothy joined in the efforts and began working to build the progressive movement in Clark County. She worked tirelessly to register voters and inform them about the caucus process. In her role as a community organizer, she developed and encouraged emergent leaders throughout the county to build a cohesive network of dynamic organizers and volunteers. As assistant director of the non-profit startup Concerned Humans Against Poverty (CHAP) Dorothy has organized dozens of volunteers that are making immediate positive changes for our houseless neighbors. Dorothy works to support other veterans and is the First Vice Chair of Washington State Veterans and Military Families Caucus.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Roboto-Slab, sans-serif; color: #343438; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline;\">&rdquo;<em>I saw a nation that jumps into conflict without compelling reason, and wastes precious resources and life in the process.

Growing up in a house with two public school teachers, Bryan learned the value of hard work and the benefits that come from a great public education. Bryan attended public schools his whole life and earned an academic scholarship to UCLA. He then took out student loans to attend Yale Law School, where he represented tenants who were being taken advantage of by unscrupulous landlords. After graduating, Bryan started his career by going into public service and working for a United States federal judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, giving him firsthand experience with our broken immigration and criminal justice systems. For the last eight years, Bryan has practiced as an attorney in Southern California taking on big banks, insurance companies, and corporations for screwing people over since the financial collapse. Throughout his career, Bryan has seen a system in which far too many banks and corporations take advantage of the people they&rsquo;re supposed to serve &ndash; either because they know they won&rsquo;t get caught, or, even worse, because career politicians have written the rules to let corporate special interests get richer at the expense of the middle class. Bryan is running for Congress because it&rsquo;s time we rip up the old rules, reign in the corporate special interests, and build a new system where hard-working Americans come first.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Roboto-Slab, sans-serif; color: #343438; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline;\">&rdquo;<em>Unless we dramatically reform our political system, insurance companies will continue to control our health care, oil companies will continue to dictate how we respond to climate change, and corporations will continue to get massive tax breaks for shipping jobs overseas&hellip; I strongly support a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United, and I will fight for publicly financed elections, eliminating money from politics, and complete transparency for all political contributions.</em>&rdquo; - <span style=\"color: #22839c;\"><strong>Bryan Caforio</strong></span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Roboto-Slab, sans-serif; color: #343438; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline;\">Help us spread the message about <strong>Bryan Caforio&rsquo;s</strong> mission to bring real change to California and to America and make some calls!&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Roboto-Slab,sans-serif; color: #561678; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline;\"><span style=\"color: #58919f;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #343438;\">To read the rest of Bryan Caforio&rsquo;s story,&nbsp;</span></strong><span style=\"color: #22839c;\"><a href=\"http://bryancaforio.com/\"><strong>click or tap here</strong>.</a></span></span></span></p></div>","type":"html-textarea","title":"Calling Prompt","key":"calling_prompt","children":null},{"value":"Callable","type":"radio-buttons","title":"Callable","required":true,"options":[{"value":"Callable"},{"value":"Not Callable"}],"key":"callable","children":null},{"value":"False","type":"radio-buttons","title":"Priority","options":[{"value":"True"},{"value":"False"}],"key":"priority","children":null},{"value":"CA-25","type":"text","title":"District","required":true,"key":"district","children":null},{"value":1014629,"type":"text","title":"Livevox Service Id","key":"livevox_service_id","children":null},{"value":"5a7f63c25cdac716e3a52646","type":"object","title":"Script","object_type":"infos","object":{"type_slug":"infos","title":"Bryan Caforio Script","status":"published","slug":"bryan-caforio-script","published_at":"2018-03-25T05:09:43.370Z","publish_at":null,"modified_by":"59a81f884a42effa2300007c","modified_at":"2018-03-25T05:09:43.370Z","metafields":[{"value":"Published","type":"radio-buttons","title":"Visibility","options":[{"value":"Draft"},{"value":"Published"}],"key":"visibility","children":null},{"value":["jd"],"type":"check-boxes","title":"Brands","required":true,"options":[{"value":"jd"},{"value":"bnc"}],"key":"brands","children":null},{"value":"Empty","type":"radio-buttons","title":"Should Header/Footer","required":true,"options":[{"value":"Full"},{"value":"Empty"}],"key":"empty","children":null},{"value":"","type":"html-textarea","title":"BNC Content","key":"bnc_content","children":null},{"value":"<p><a name=\"top\"></a></p><h2>Bryan Caforio Phone Banking Script</h2><hr><h2>Introduction:</h2><p>Hi, may I speak with __________?

Growing up in a house with two public school teachers, Bryan learned the value of hard work and the benefits that come from a great public education. Bryan attended public schools his whole life and earned an academic scholarship to UCLA. He then took out student loans to attend Yale Law School, where he represented tenants who were being taken advantage of by unscrupulous landlords. After graduating, Bryan started his career by going into public service and working for a United States federal judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, giving him firsthand experience with our broken immigration and criminal justice systems. For the last eight years, Bryan has practiced as an attorney in Southern California taking on big banks, insurance companies, and corporations for screwing people over since the financial collapse. Throughout his career, Bryan has seen a system in which far too many banks and corporations take advantage of the people they&rsquo;re supposed to serve &ndash; either because they know they won&rsquo;t get caught, or, even worse, because career politicians have written the rules to let corporate special interests get richer at the expense of the middle class. Bryan is running for Congress because it&rsquo;s time we rip up the old rules, reign in the corporate special interests, and build a new system where hard-working Americans come first.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Roboto-Slab, sans-serif; color: #343438; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline;\">&rdquo;<em>Unless we dramatically reform our political system, insurance companies will continue to control our health care, oil companies will continue to dictate how we respond to climate change, and corporations will continue to get massive tax breaks for shipping jobs overseas&hellip; I strongly support a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United, and I will fight for publicly financed elections, eliminating money from politics, and complete transparency for all political contributions.</em>&rdquo; - <span style=\"color: #22839c;\"><strong>Bryan Caforio</strong></span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Roboto-Slab, sans-serif; color: #343438; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline;\">Help us spread the message about <strong>Bryan Caforio&rsquo;s</strong> mission to bring real change to California and to America and make some calls!&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Roboto-Slab,sans-serif; color: #561678; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline;\"><span style=\"color: #58919f;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #343438;\">To read the rest of Bryan Caforio&rsquo;s story,&nbsp;</span></strong><span style=\"color: #22839c;\"><a href=\"http://bryancaforio.com/\"><strong>click or tap here</strong>.</a></span></span></span></p></div>","callable":"Callable","brands":["jd"]},"created_by":"59e634d679323a6748000300","created_at":"2017-12-18T15:07:31.437Z","created":"2017-12-18T15:07:31.437Z","content":"","bucket":"59397094f15158ea07003890","_id":"5a37d9b325426ee05400008b"},{"type_slug":"candidates","title":"Adrienne Bell","status":"published","slug":"adrienne-bell","publish_at":null,"modified_by":"59a81f884a42effa2300007c","modified_at":"2018-03-07T16:16:02.236Z","metafields":[{"value":"TX-14","type":"text","title":"District","required":true,"key":"district","children":null},{"value":"Join me in creating a Brand New Congress","type":"text","title":"Signup Prompt","required":true,"key":"signup_prompt","children":null},{"value":"566bc9a0-c403-11e7-b589-b79c36789960-JD_Site_AdrienneBell_1000x600_102717.jpg","url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cosmicjs/566bc9a0-c403-11e7-b589-b79c36789960-JD_Site_AdrienneBell_1000x600_102717.jpg","type":"file","title":"Small Picture","key":"small_picture","imgix_url":"https://cosmic-s3.imgix.net/566bc9a0-c403-11e7-b589-b79c36789960-JD_Site_AdrienneBell_1000x600_102717.jpg","children":null},{"value":"<p>Texas has one of the most robust economies in the country -- even the world.
